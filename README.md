# GUIDatabase
## Project Overview

Simply, a JavaFX project connected to a Derby database. 
When run, a window pops up with a button to connect, update, or delete. When connect is pressed, a first and last name is printed after a predetermined SQL statement is run through the database. When delete is pressed, it will delete the record and print "Deleted".
